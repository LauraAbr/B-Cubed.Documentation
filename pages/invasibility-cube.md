title: Specification for invasibility cubes and their production
description: >
  This document presents the specification for "invasibility cubes”, to visualise invasion fitness and invasibility. It provides a workflow to visualise invasion fitness, using species occurrence data, Invasive Alien Species (IAS) lists, and species traits to calculate trait centrality, visualise trait dispersion, estimate interaction strength, and assess invasibility.

## Task 4.3: Network invasibility cube [Lead: SUN]

Develop a workflow to visualise invasion fitness, using species occurrence data, IAS lists, and species traits to calculate trait centrality, visualize trait dispersion, estimate interaction strength, and assess invasibility. Outputs include interaction strength matrices and community dynamics details under biological invasions.

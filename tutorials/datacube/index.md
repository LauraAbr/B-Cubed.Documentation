## What are Data Cubes? 
A data cube is a multidimensional representation of data that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of information along multiple dimensions. In the context of biodiversity data, a data cube can integrate various dimensions such as taxonomic (what), temporal (when) and spatial (where), enabling researchers to explore complex ecological patterns and relationships more effectively.

# All documentation on modelled data cubes

4.1 Suitability cube [UNIBO]
Develop workflows for predictive habitat suitability modeling using 'Dismo' R package, incorporating species occurrence data, environmental data (e.g., Copernicus, WorldClim, Cordex), & socio-ecological scenarios to create maps for species distributions under current & future global change scenarios.
Oct 2024: M11 – Code design:  Predictive habitat suitability modelling | Mar 2025: M12 – Code test: Predictive habitat suitability modelling

4.2 Dissimilarity cube [SUN]
Design workflows to compile a co-occurrence matrix for species in a geographic area, source georeferenced environmental data, and map compositional dissimilarity using ‘MS-GDM', 'zetadiv', and 'SSDM' R packages. This includes identifying bioregions and predicting future compositional turnover and bioregion shifts.
Nov 2024: M13 – Code design: Map compositional dissimilarity & turnover | Apr 2025: M14 – Code test: Map compositional dissimilarity & turnover

4.3 Network invasibility cube [SUN]
Develop a workflow to visualise invasion fitness, using species occurrence data, IAS lists, and species traits to calculate trait centrality, visualize trait dispersion, estimate interaction strength, and assess invasibility. Outputs include interaction strength matrices and community dynamics details under biological invasions.
Dec 2024: M15 – Code design: Visualise trait dispersion to assess invasibility | May 2025: M16 – Code test: Visualise trait dispersion to assess invasibility

## 4.3 Network invasibility cube [SUN]
Develop a workflow to visualise invasion fitness, using species occurrence data, IAS lists, and species traits to calculate trait centrality, visualize trait dispersion, estimate interaction strength, and assess invasibility. Outputs include interaction strength matrices and community dynamics details under biological invasions.

Dec 2024: M15 – Code design: Visualise trait dispersion to assess invasibility | May 2025: M16 – Code test: Visualise trait dispersion to assess invasibility.

## Task 4.2: Dissimilarity cube [Lead: SUN]

Design workflows to compile a co-occurrence matrix for species in a geographic area, source georeferenced environmental data, and map compositional dissimilarity using ‘MS-GDM', 'zetadiv', and 'SSDM' R packages. This includes identifying bioregions and predicting future compositional turnover and bioregion shifts.
